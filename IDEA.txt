Q: DESCRIBE YOUR IDEA.
A:Create a gaming web based application for college students where users can
create and join lobbys for different games, inform people what and when they
are planning to play,etc.
+Plans to add rating for the event hosts, So that people can decide which host to join
+Even the users can get XP of some kind that will help them level up to basically "Show off" (Cuz thats wt we want!)
+Since its not only about gaming, Need other members to throw in some ideas about other events and stuff

Q: WHAT REAL WORLD PROBLEM(S) ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE?
A:Trying to remove the hurdle of people having to search for other interested
gamers because of not knowing their interests or not having a suitable 
platform to discuss such things
+Loneliness


Q: HAS IT ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED BEFORE?
A:currently existing applications cater to creating online lobbys and not
for organizing such events where players come together to the same place
and play together as a team(eg in college).
OR
it can also be used by fest organizers to make the process of registering
automatic.

Q: IF YES, HOW IS IT GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM EXISTING PRODUCTS?
A:already answered :P
+Current> Join a game lobby > Play (Less social interaction)
 Our Idea>  Join a Lobby (Not in game) > Meet people > Talk > Play > Have fun

Q: WHAT TECHNOLOGIES DO YOU WANT TO USE (OPTIONAL)?
A:
Machine learning
Aerodynamics
Quantum Physics
Rocket science
MRI scanner
Chemistry
Software Engineering???
